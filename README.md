This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
Yes it is and it has some configured feature, because I'm dealing with bootstrap this stack soo many times so - this was created beacue I'm lazy 😎

## Getting Started - NextJS all for running:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## More scripts:

For running your tests suits run:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

For better DX try testing with watch mode 😎

```bash
npm run test:watch
# or
yarn test:watch
```

## Example included:

There are two examples included in this template:

- Counter - provide very minimum example of using redux toolkit - for more pls go to docs.
- Techs - provide some MSW mock API calls.

This example living in `components` direcotry but - [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) documentation is proposed using `feature` direcotry structure where all your components living in the same directory with you store logic file.

I'm not sure about a folders structure here 🤷‍♂️ consider use [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) for more complex solution.

!NOTE: when you clone this boilerplate u can delete this components.
